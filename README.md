# cond-utils
a place to store some Common Lisp expressions

Most of these are short expressions: I am particularly interested in writing s-exprs
that use "classic Lisp" constructs (like cond, car/cdr combinations, & some of the 
more imperative forms that have been with Lisp since the beginning, but have
fallen-out of favor (e.g. the prog family, go/tags, side-effecting functions)),
recursive expressions, math/stats stuff, and basically anything else that works with
a new (to me)/unfamiliar/under-documented/interesting mechanism of the language. What I
like about CL is that the running Lisp image is basically really good at number-crunching
while also being basically a pointer-machine w/ "infinite" registers.

Many of these expressions are not idiomatic, probably not optimized/optimazable, and very
likely would not integrate well with a larger project, but on the other hand, maybe I'll
have accidentally stumbled-upon some under-appreciated mechanism that might help someone 
out.
